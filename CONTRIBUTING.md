## How to contribute

First, I'm glad you consider improving `zurvan`! 

You can contribute to the project in many ways:

 - tell your friends / coworkers about it
 - create a bug report (if you encountered weird/unexpected behavior)
 - create a feature request (if you find a feature you'd like to have)
 - comment on an issue to prioritize it
 - create a pull request with fixes or improvements
 
Rules are really simple!

If you report a bug - please include:

 - what happened
 - what did you expect to happen
 - what did you do
 - on what environment (e.g. Node version)
 - was it a permanent problem or an intermittent one
 
If you request a feature - please include:

 - what do you want to achieve
 - (optional) what interface calls would you like to use
 
If you create a pull request - please include:

 - issue id (in pull request description, not necessarily in commits)
 - test cases
 - working production code
 
`zurvan` has ~99% test coverage, and I really want it to remain at this level, so please verify.
 
There are no strict rules about commits - it's best if commit titles are descriptive, but that's it - you don't have to squash, rebase and do other Git magic.

As for coding style - please stick to ECMA Script 5. Check code around and try to blend in. 

And that's it!
