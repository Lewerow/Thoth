0.2.4:
 - added environment compatibility check - if required functions are not available in environment, zurvan will throw proper error at `require`

0.2.3:
 - *BREAKING CHANGE* expireAllTimeouts() and forwardTimeToNextTimer clear the queue even if there are no timeouts (previously it was resolved immediately)
 - *BREAKING CHANGE* releaseTimers() is now resolved with leftovers from execution
 - added option to intercept timers while ignoring Date function - it may cause problems in setups that require high compatibility, so now it can be at least suppressed
 - fixed a bug - zurvan does not crash anymore when called as argument of util.format
 - zurvan is running in strict mode now
 
0.2.2:
 - added option to throw when argument to clearTimeout/clearInterval is not a valid timer issued by proper set function
 - fixed a bug - when clearTimeout/clearInterval is called with undefined, it no longer crashes
 
0.2.1:
 - *BREAKING CHANGE* removed hack for modifying original setImmediate fields for bluebird compatibility. 
 Now bluebird.setScheduler is used
 - fixed a bug - waitForEmptyQueue() waits now longer (hopefully until queue is cleared)
previously there was a problem in scenario setImmediate(process.nextTick(setImmediate)))

0.2.0:
 - *BREAKING CHANGE* blockSystem does no longer return a Promise, and is a synchronous call instead
 - added option to ignore faking process timers (process.hrtime and process.uptime)
 - added option to throw on values < 1 passed to setTimeout / setInterval
 - added option for adding per-module configuration
 - added compatibility option to run smoothly with bluebird
 - documentation fixes
 - fixed bug: microqueue tasks in last timeout were not executed before resolving advanceTime promises
