 - added option to throw when argument to clearTimeout/clearInterval is not a valid timer issued by proper set function
 - fixed a bug - when clearTimeout/clearInterval is called with undefined, it no longer crashes

 - *BREAKING CHANGE* removed hack for modifying original setImmediate fields for bluebird compatibility.
