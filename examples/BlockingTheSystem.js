/*
  Example below is pretty rare - it should be used to simulate high load - for example a long, continous computation.
  During this time no timer callbacks are executed, but all expired timers are moved to the event queue.
  This is done regardless of their due time, so only basic ordering is preserved.
  Called functions will push numbers to an array.
  
  Mocha structure is used to make sure that examples will stay up-to-date with library code
